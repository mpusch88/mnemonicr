We are creating an application called mnemonicr - it is a C# / WPF desktop application that allows searching for user accounts in active directory to retrieve their corresponding mnemonics. It provides a simple interface for the user to enter a list of names and/or emails, and searches for matches in the active directory using a PowerShell script. Mnemonicr then returns a formatted list of the mnemonics for the matched user accounts.
